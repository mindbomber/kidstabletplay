# kidstabletplay
An app for very young children that can teach kids science technology engineering art and mathematics. The app has a static interface with objects the child can interact with and side scroll to uncover more things.  Kind of like looking at a beautiful picture or scenery that you can interact with if you choose. And if you do choose to interact with it the scenery can also teach the user about physics, counting, putting things together, drawing, etc.  Scenery can also be reset. Good for strollers or car-seats and better than just  watching videos because of interaction.
